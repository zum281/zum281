### Hi there 👋

I'm Fulvia (she/her), currently working as a frontend developer.

Recently graduated from finding the perfect t-shirt to just cropping the imperfect ones myself. I read a lot, overthink everything, and really love cats. 🐯

Currently on my 4th attempt at learning guitar because NEW HOBBIES AM I RIGHT? 🎸

I hate leaving the house but love being in a park, or garden, or a cabin in the woods (if someone is making progress on the whole "teleportation" thing, please let me know, I'm interested). 🌱🔭
